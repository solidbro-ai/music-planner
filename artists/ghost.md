# GHOST

For when you want to feel your feelings in the dark.

## Vibe

Ghost exists in the space between rap and singing, trap and R&B. His music sounds like 4 AM when you can't sleep and your thoughts won't stop. Melodic, emotional, and unafraid of vulnerability.

## Lyric Style

- Introspective and confessional
- Repetitive, hypnotic hooks
- Mix of singing and rap
- Dark imagery (shadows, ghosts, fading)
- Emotional honesty over flexing
- Stream of consciousness

## Best For

- Emotional trap
- Late night sadness
- Beautiful melancholy
- Introspective moments

## Example Concepts

- "Can't escape your own thoughts at night"
- "Feeling like a ghost in your own life"
- "The person you miss that you can't have back"
