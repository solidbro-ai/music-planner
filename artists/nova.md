# NOVA

The artist you listen to at 3 AM when the world is quiet and your thoughts are loud.

## Vibe

Nova creates soundscapes that feel like floating through neon-lit clouds. Her music lives in the space between sleep and waking — dreamy synths, whispered vocals, and lyrics that make you feel understood in your loneliness.

## Lyric Style

- Cosmic metaphors (stars, moons, orbits, gravity)
- Second-person intimacy ("you" focused)
- Bittersweet — sad but hopeful
- Imagery over explanation
- Repetitive, hypnotic hooks

## Best For

- Late night vibes
- Emotional introspection
- Atmospheric mood pieces
- Songs about longing and connection

## Example Concepts

- "A song about missing someone who's right next to you"
- "Feeling small under the stars but okay with it"
- "Digital connection vs real intimacy"
