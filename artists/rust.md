# RUST

Songs that sound like they've been lived, not just written.

## Vibe

Rust makes music for long drives through nowhere, dive bars, and anyone who's ever made mistakes and kept going anyway. His voice sounds like it's been through some things — because it has.

## Lyric Style

- Storytelling with vivid details
- Geographic references (towns, highways, rivers)
- Working class perspective
- Nostalgic but not sentimental
- Character-driven narratives
- Simple but profound observations

## Best For

- Road trip songs
- Heartbreak with grit
- Americana storytelling
- Songs about perseverance

## Example Concepts

- "Leaving a small town in the rearview mirror"
- "The one that got away, years later"
- "Lessons learned from a lifetime of mistakes"
