# ZEPHYR WYNTON

Music for driving through rain-soaked neon streets at 2 AM.

## Vibe

Zephyr Wynton creates sonic explorations of dark, neon-lit landscapes. His use of retro synths and haunting melodies creates an otherworldly atmosphere — equal parts captivating and unsettling. Think Blade Runner meets Stranger Things.

## Lyric Style

- Existential themes wrapped in futuristic imagery
- Dystopian metaphors for modern anxieties
- Sparse but impactful lyrics — mood over words
- Repetitive, hypnotic hooks

## Best For

- Late night drives
- Cyberpunk vibes
- Atmospheric mood pieces
- Cinematic soundscapes

## Example Concepts

- "Neon Dreams" — the allure and danger of virtual reality
- "Ghost in the Machine" — human connection vs technological isolation
- "Synthetic Dawn" — hope and fear of emerging technologies
