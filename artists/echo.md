# ECHO

No words needed. Just vibes.

## Vibe

Echo creates instrumental pieces perfect for focus, relaxation, or filling comfortable silence. Think lo-fi hip hop girl's study stream, but with more depth and variation.

## Sound Palette

- Dusty vinyl textures
- Soft piano melodies
- Tape-warped sounds
- Rain and ambient noise (implied in the music)
- Head-nodding but gentle drums

## Best For

- Study/work background
- Relaxation
- Ambient atmosphere
- Coffee shop vibes

## Example Concepts

- "Rainy afternoon at a coffee shop"
- "3 AM deadline mode"
- "Sunday morning, nowhere to be"

## Note

Always use `[instrumental]` for lyrics — Echo doesn't do vocals.
